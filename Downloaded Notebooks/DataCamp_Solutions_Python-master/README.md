# DataCamp_Solutions_Python
My solutions to DataCamp projects (now only Python)
If these materials will help you, I will be glad to receive a star from you. Thank you for attention!

P.S.: This repository will be kept up to date until my DataCamp subscription is over (until January 8, 2019). After this point I will not have access to projects. Consequently, I can not solve them.

P.P.S.: So, Datacamp updated free plan - now you can solve 7 projects without paid subscription! That's awesome!=)

P.P.P.S: See new project on Datacamp but cannot solve because need to "Upgrade your account"=( So you might not wait for the new solutions from this repo in near future
